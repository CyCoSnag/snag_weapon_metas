# Weapon Meta's by Snag [FiveM] [Standalone] [Free]

A FiveM resource that allows server owners to change game weapon's metadata. This can be used to change damage, 
damage types, ammo count, defaults, camera angles, aiming, recoil, weapon effects, smoke effects, etc.

This resource allows you to edit all player and vehicle weapons' meta files. This can be used to change damage, damage types, ammo count, defaults, camera angles, aiming, recoil, weapon effects, smoke effects, disable the combat roll, etc.

Editing a weapons meta is an easy and optimized way to balance weapons for your server. Here are a few examples of what you can do:

Change how sniper rifles work: I've removed the sniper scope, added third-person aim, added third-person focus zoom, added recoil, lowered bullet speed (to simulate projectile fire), lowered first-person FOV, added first-person ADS, changed first-person weapon offsets to fit the gun properly for first-person ADS, etc.

Change how shotguns work: I've edited the default pump shotgun to work as a less-than-lethal bean-bag shotgun by changing the bullet type, lowering the bullet count to 1, increasing accuracy, lowering bullet spread to 0, balanced force applied, balanced min and max force applied distance, limited the distance to hit to only 10 meters, changed damage type to that of the stun gun, changed the damage over time to 7 seconds (how long your character is tased), etc.

You can change them however you want!

The version I'm releasing here includes the original GTAV meta files and DLC meta files.

I will be re-releasing this later on as a paid resource with balance changes more suitable in a role play server. This will include the sniper and less-than-lethal changes showcased here.
